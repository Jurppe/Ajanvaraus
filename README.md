# Ajanvaraus
Small project for testing server and client side communications. Nothing too fancy, just to own education.

Simple Calendar UI, with customer accounts and employee accounts. Customer can set up 30min meeting with chosen employee.

<b>Program lacks major part of error checking, and is therefore completely unfinished.</b>
